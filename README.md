# wp-number-input-buttons

##BEWARE##
This could clash with other plugins that are already adding incremental buttons to their number inputs. I am planning to add the ability to change the selector and make it only add buttons where you want them. Feel free to fork it and go crazy :-)

##What Does this Do##

Adds nice Font Awesome buttons on either side of all number inputs. This is a WordPress plugin but it could be used for any site with a little modding.
